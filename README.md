# John Mark Estiller Davalos😎

Hi, my name is John Mark Davalos, but most people call me **Macky** M-A-C-K-Y (people often spell it wrong).

I was born in **Barcelona, Sorsogon**, and I grew up in a barangay there named **Sta. Lourdes**.  
I started school at 3 years old in a daycare center, and by 5 I was in grade school at **Sta. Lourdes Elementary School**.  
It was a small school with only a few hundred students, and I stayed there from Grade 1 to Grade 6 until I graduated.  
I wasn’t really an academic achiever just enough to be noticed by my teacher, but not enough to walk on stage.

For high school I went to **San Antonio National High School**, another small school, and I stayed there from Grade 7 to Grade 12.  
In high school I started to be somewhat of an academic achiever, but then COVID struck when I was in Grade 7.  
To most people, especially those living in urban areas, COVID was rough, but for me living in a mountainous area it was actually a blast.  
I had unlimited time to play, no school, no homework, except for the modules (those sucked), but other than that it was pretty cool.

Time skip to **Grade 10** the last year of junior high this was the peak of high school life.  
Everybody was in the same room, the gang was complete, and the teachers were top-notch and chill.  
After junior high graduation some friends left the school while some stayed, including me.

**Grade 11** was still pretty cool, but the gang wasn’t complete anymore.  
Some left for another school, and sadly one friend died in a vehicular accident (RIP bro, still miss you).  
This was the time I started to become an “academic weapon,” though I still hated math really hated it even though I could do it.  
My strand was **GAS (General Academic Strand)**.

Then came **Grade 12**, the last year of high school.  
A lot happened competitions, my highest grade ever and finally graduation.


## Hobbies 🏀
Playing basketball, sleeping, eating, watching anime, napping, cooking, hiking, traveling, swimming, listening to music,  
playing with my dogs 🐕, playing guitar, playing drums, riding my 200cc motorcycle,  
playing **Mobile Legends: Bang Bang**, and watching movies.

## Interests / Goals 💯
Have a lot of money, spend a lot of money, travel to other countries, build passive income (using AI),  
live the life I always wanted, and be somebody.

## Fun Facts 💡
- I can go 20 days without eating just water and pure willpower.  
- When I took the BUCET, I honestly didn’t think I’d pass, much less qualify.  
  The day of the exam it was raining heavily and my motorcycle kept choking because water was getting into the muffler.  
  I arrived about 15 minutes late, completely soaked, with my shoes leaking water everywhere it literally looked like I’d peed my pants.  
  Pretty embarrassing, but a few months later I got the results and somehow managed to clutch it.  
  I’m super thankful I got in and don’t have to pay tuition.
